<h1>Plasmmer Lottery -> PoolTogether</h1>
<p>Plasmmer Lottery didn't even launched and was ceased, for good.</p>
<p>For transparency, you can see what this site looked like back in 2016, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160820205359/http://lottery.plasmmer.com/" target="_blank">here</a>. Please don't donate to any BTC address, because Plasmmer Lottery never launched and is ceased.</p>
