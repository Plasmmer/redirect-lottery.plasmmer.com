<h1>Plasmmer Lottery -> PoolTogether</h1>
<p>Plasmmer Lottery didn't even launched and was ceased, for good.</p>
<p>For transparency, you can see what this site looked like back in 2016, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160820205359/http://lottery.plasmmer.com/" target="_blank">here</a>. Please don't donate to any BTC address, because Plasmmer Lottery never launched and is ceased.</p>

<h3>The future of lotteries wasn't made by Plasmmer, but by another "P":</h3>
<h2><a href="https://pooltogether.com/pt" target="_blank"><img width="24px" src="https://pooltogether.com/favicon.ico"/> Go to PoolTogether</a>!</h2>
<p><b>Why</b>: PoolTogether is the future of lotteries because it's secured by the Ethereum blockchain and your spending on tickets aren't a waste: they can return to you at any moment you choose to!</p>
